Project done by Dhivya Balaje, Feroze Ahmed J, Deepak K, Santhosh G, Adlin Raja D 

Problem Statement:
Develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a bank loan will be classified as a Good or Bad

Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Removed anomalies, duplicates, and filled missing values
2. Feature Engineering: Created financial ratios, encoded categorical variables
3. Feature Reduction: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) â†’ reduced from 91 to 45 features
4. Model Training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
5. Validation: K-fold and stratified K-fold cross-validation
